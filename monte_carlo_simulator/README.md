## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd monte_carlo_simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Web Service

```bash
python api_service.py
```

Or using uvicorn directly:

```bash
uvicorn api_service:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3. Open the Web Interface

Navigate to: http://localhost:8000

## Using the Simulator

### Web Interface

1. **Choose a Preset** (optional):
   - **Base Case**: Option B strategy from executive summary
   - **Conservative**: Cloud-only, slower growth, lower risk
   - **Aggressive**: Regional datacenter, faster growth
   - **Premium**: GPU at edge, military focus

2. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - **Architecture**: Choose Option A, B, or C
   - **Growth Strategy**: Set cable deployment targets
   - **Pricing**: Adjust monthly prices by customer segment
   - **Team**: Configure initial size and growth rate
   - **Simulation**: Number of Monte Carlo runs (more = slower but more accurate)

3. **Run Simulation**:
   - Click "ðŸš€ Run Simulation"
   - Wait 10-30 seconds (depending on number of simulations)

4. **Analyze Results**:
   - **Success Rate**: Probability of achieving profitability
   - **Series B Qualified**: Probability of hitting $30M ARR milestone
   - **Final Metrics**: Cables, customers, ARR with P10/P50/P90 ranges
   - **Charts**: Revenue, costs, cash, growth trajectories

### API Usage

You can also use the API directly:

```python
import requests

# Configure simulation
config = {
    "architecture_option": "B",
    "series_a_funding": 10000000,
    "target_cables_month_12": 15,
    "target_cables_month_18": 30,
    "pricing_port": 35000,
    "pricing_naval": 500000,
    "num_simulations": 1000,
    "simulation_months": 24
}

# Run simulation
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/simulate", json=config)
results = response.json()

# Analyze
print(f"Success rate: {results['analysis']['success_metrics']['profitability_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Median ARR: ${results['analysis']['final_metrics']['arr']['median']/1e6:.1f}M")
```

## Understanding the Results

### Success Metrics

- **Profitability Rate**: % of simulations that achieve positive gross margin (>70%)
- **Series B Qualified Rate**: % that reach $30M ARR with 15+ cables
- **Failure Rate**: % that run out of cash before profitability

### Final Metrics (at Month 18 or 24)

For each output metric, you get:
- **Median (P50)**: Middle outcome - 50% of simulations above/below
- **P10**: Pessimistic outcome - only 10% of simulations worse
- **P90**: Optimistic outcome - only 10% of simulations better

### Charts

- **Revenue & Costs**: Shows P10/P50/P90 trajectories
- **Cash Position**: Critical for runway planning
- **Growth**: Cables deployed and customers acquired
- **Team & Infrastructure**: Scaling requirements
- **Technical Metrics**: Detection accuracy over time

## Key Decision Questions Answered

### 1. Architecture Choice (Option A vs B vs C)

**Question**: Which architecture option provides the best risk-adjusted returns?

**How to use simulator**:
- Run simulations with each architecture option
- Compare success rates and final ARR
- Check failure rates (ran out of cash)

**Example findings**:
- Option C: Lower upfront costs, good for Phase 1
- Option B: Better unit economics at 10+ cables
- Option A: Higher costs, lower success rate unless targeting military

### 2. Growth Strategy

**Question**: How aggressively should we deploy cables?

**How to use simulator**:
- Vary `target_cables_month_12` and `target_cables_month_18`
- Compare cash remaining vs ARR achieved
- Find the sweet spot between growth and runway

**Example findings**:
- Too aggressive (40 cables by M18): 60% run out of cash
- Too conservative (10 cables by M18): Profitable but low ARR, miss Series B
- Optimal (20-30 cables by M18): Balance growth and survival

### 3. Pricing Strategy

**Question**: Can we charge more or should we go lower to acquire faster?

**How to use simulator**:
- Adjust pricing by segment
- See impact on customer acquisition and revenue
- Note: Lower prices don't directly increase conversion in model (you may want to adjust `conversion_rate_port_mean`)

### 4. Team Sizing

**Question**: How many engineers do we need and when?

**How to use simulator**:
- Adjust `initial_team_size` and `team_growth_rate`
- See impact on costs and ability to scale
- Current model assumes team scales with operational needs

### 5. Funding Requirements

**Question**: Is $10M Series A sufficient? When do we need Series B?

**How to use simulator**:
- Vary `series_a_funding`
- Check `cash_remaining` trajectory
- See when `series_b_qualified` becomes true
- Determine ideal Series B timing

## Model Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

1. **Customer acquisition**:
   - Leads scale with cables deployed
   - Conversion rates are stochastic (normal distribution)
   - Sales effectiveness ramps over 12 months

2. **Costs**:
   - Edge infrastructure scales linearly with cables
   - Regional datacenter kicks in at 8 cables (Option B)
   - Cloud costs scale with data volume
   - Team costs based on role distribution

3. **Technical**:
   - Detection accuracy centered at 97% (epsilon=0.1)
   - System uptime ~99.5%
   - Detections per cable ~50/day

4. **Market**:
   - 10% annual price erosion from competition
   - Monthly churn ~2%

### Limitations

1. **No external funding events**: Doesn't model Series B infusion mid-simulation
2. **Simplified customer acquisition**: Doesn't model marketing spend â†’ conversion relationship explicitly
3. **No seasonality**: Customer acquisition and costs are constant
4. **No competition dynamics**: Doesn't model competitive responses
5. **Simplified team model**: Team roles are percentage-based, not optimized for actual needs

### Extending the Model

To add your own stochastic parameters:

```python
# In das_monte_carlo.py, modify StochasticParameters

@dataclass
class StochasticParameters:
    # Add your parameter
    my_new_param_mean: float = 100
    my_new_param_std: float = 10
    
# Then use in simulation
value = np.random.normal(
    self.params.my_new_param_mean,
    self.params.my_new_param_std
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Running from Command Line

```python
# Run a quick test
python das_monte_carlo.py

# Run custom simulation
from das_monte_carlo import *

inputs = SimulationInputs(
    architecture_option=ArchitectureOption.OPTION_B_REGIONAL_DC,
    target_cables_month_18=40
)
params = StochasticParameters()

simulator = DASMonteCarloSimulator(inputs, params)
results = simulator.run_monte_carlo(num_simulations=5000)

analysis = analyze_results(results)
print(json.dumps(analysis, indent=2))
```

### Exporting Results

```python
# Save trajectories to CSV
import pandas as pd

for i, result in enumerate(results):
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'month': result.months,
        'cables': result.cables_deployed,
        'revenue': result.revenue_monthly,
        'cash': result.cash_remaining
    })
    df.to_csv(f'simulation_{i}.csv', index=False)
```

## Files

- `das_monte_carlo.py`: Core simulation engine
- `api_service.py`: FastAPI web service wrapper
- `static/index.html`: Web interface
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `README.md`: This file

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'"

Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "Address already in use" when starting service

Change port: `uvicorn api_service:app --port 8001`

### Simulation takes too long

Reduce `num_simulations` from 1000 to 100-500 for faster results

### Results don't match executive summary

The Monte Carlo includes uncertainty - executive summary uses deterministic "base case" assumptions. Your results should cluster around executive summary numbers.

## Next Steps

1. **Validate assumptions**: Review `StochasticParameters` and adjust means/stds based on your domain knowledge
2. **Sensitivity analysis**: Run multiple scenarios varying one parameter at a time
3. **Risk analysis**: Focus on scenarios where `ran_out_of_cash` is true - what went wrong?
4. **Decision support**: Use P10/P50/P90 ranges to set realistic targets and communicate uncertainty to board

## Questions?

This simulator is designed to help you answer the questions in `INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md`. For each major decision, run scenarios and compare outcomes.

The goal is not to predict the future exactly, but to:
1. Understand ranges of outcomes
2. Identify key risks
3. Make informed strategic choices
4. Communicate uncertainty to stakeholders
