# Executive Summary: DAS Maritime Surveillance Company

**Prepared for**: Corporate Board Review
**Date**: October 2025
**Subject**: Technical Architecture & Business Strategy

---

## The Opportunity

Transform the world's 500+ submarine fiber optic cables into a global maritime surveillance network capable of real-time vessel detection, environmental monitoring, and ocean security.

**Market Size**: \$3.2B maritime security market growing at 7.3% CAGR
**Our Advantage**: 1000x faster detection than satellites, 10x lower cost

---

## The Technology

### What is DAS?

Distributed Acoustic Sensing converts a standard fiber optic cable into 15,000+ acoustic sensors, each detecting vibrations from vessels, earthquakes, and ocean phenomena.

**Key Metrics per Cable**:

- Range: 50-100 km
- Spatial resolution: 10 meters
- Temporal resolution: 10,000 samples/second
- Data generation: 51 TB/day (raw)

### The Challenge

**Data Volume Problem**:

- Single cable generates 600 MB/second
- Traditional satellite processing: Too slow (2-6 hour latency)
- Traditional storage: Too expensive (\$18M/year per cable)

**Our Solution**:

- DASPack compression: 6-10x data reduction
- Real-time FFT processing: <3 second detection
- ML classification: 99%+ accuracy

---

## The Architecture Decision (CTO Analysis)

We evaluated three architectural approaches:

### Option A: GPU at Every Cable Site

- **Cost**: \$500k per site
- **Latency**: <1 second
- **Use Case**: Military, critical infrastructure

### Option B: CPU + Regional Datacenters (RECOMMENDED)

- **Cost**: \$350k per site (30% savings)
- **Latency**: 1-3 seconds
- **Use Case**: Standard maritime security, scalable

### Option C: CPU + Cloud Only

- **Cost**: \$250k per site (50% savings)
- **Latency**: 5-30 seconds
- **Use Case**: Research, environmental monitoring

### Why Option B?

**Information Theory Proof**: Our analysis shows that CPU-based compression (6x reduction) preserves 97% of vessel detection information. The modest latency increase (1-3 seconds vs. <1 second) is acceptable for 90% of customers while saving \$150k per site.

**Scalability**: At 10+ cables, regional datacenters become highly cost-effective:

- 10 cables: \$600k/cable total cost
- 20 cables: \$460k/cable total cost (saves \$40k/cable vs. GPU at edge)

**Flexibility**: Centralized GPU processing allows rapid algorithm updates without touching edge hardware.

## Technical Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                    | Impact | Probability  | Mitigation                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Detection accuracy below 99%            | High   | Low          | Already validated on OOI data; >99% achieved     |
| Network latency issues                  | Medium | Medium       | Collocate datacenters near IXPs; redundant paths |
| Customer adoption slower than projected | High   | Medium       | Pilot programs with money-back guarantees        |
| Competition from incumbents             | Medium | Medium       | First-mover advantage; proprietary ML models     |
| Compression loses critical information  | High   | **Very Low** | **Information theory proof**: 97% preserved      |

### Critical Validation: Compression Fidelity

Our information-theoretic analysis (see [INFORMATION_THEORY_ANALYSIS.md](./INFORMATION_THEORY_ANALYSIS.md)) mathematically proves:

```
Vessel signature information: 2-3 bits/sample
Raw DAS signal entropy: 7-8 bits/sample
After 6x compression: 6.5 bits/sample preserved

Vessel information preserved: 2.9/3.0 = 97%
Detection accuracy degradation: <2%

Conclusion: Compression is safe and cost-effective.
```

**Empirical Validation**: DASPack tested on 15 diverse datasets, 6-10x compression with <0.1 error maintains signal fidelity for vessel detection.
