# Discussion Guide: Google Network Engineer Meeting

## Key Technical Questions to Explore

### 1. Scale & Performance Insights

**Critical Questions**:

- What marine acoustic data throughputs do we see from large cable operators, like Google?
- Does managing large cable data volumes, like 200-500 TB/day, scale with the marine data?
- What were the bottlenecks at scale across many cables, and how do you overcome them?

**Why It Matters**: Understanding Google-scale solutions will help us architect for 100+ cables from day one.

### 2. Real-time Processing Architecture

**Critical Questions**:

- Can you achieve sub-second latency for anomaly detection?
- What was the GPU/TPU strategy for real-time FFT processing?
- How did you handle processing failures without data loss?

**Follow-ups**:

- Edge vs. cloud processing split?
- Batch size optimization strategies?
- Memory management for continuous streams?

### 3. DAS-Specific Challenges

**Critical Questions**:

- How did you handle interrogator failures/glitches?
- What were the unique challenges of optical phase data vs. traditional sensors?
- How did you calibrate for environmental noise (currents, temperature)?

**Technical Deep-Dives**:

- Coherent noise removal techniques
- Channel-to-channel correlation methods
- Spatial-temporal filtering approaches

### 4. Data Compression & Storage

**Critical Questions**:

- Beyond DASPack, what compression strategies worked at scale?
- How did you balance compression ratio vs. signal fidelity?
- What was the storage architecture for hot/warm/cold data?

**Specific Techniques**:

- Adaptive compression based on signal content?
- Distributed storage strategies?
- Cost optimization methods?

### 5. Compress-First vs. Vectorize-First Architecture

**The Core Question**:

```
Strategy A: Vectorize-First (FFT at edge before compression)
- GPU at edge → FFT → Features → Compress → Cloud
- Pros: Sub-second latency, preserves all signal content
- Cons: $150-200k edge cost, complex edge systems

Strategy B: Compress-First (Compress then FFT in cloud/datacenter)
- CPU at edge → DASPack compress → Cloud/DC → GPU FFT
- Pros: $30-40k edge cost, flexible algorithms
- Cons: 1-30 second latency, potential signal loss

Which would a company like Google use, and why?
```

**Information Theory Questions**:

- Does lossy compression (6-10x) destroy vessel signature information?
- What's the minimum bits/sample needed to detect vessels reliably?
- Can you recover frequency domain features from compressed time-domain data?
- At what error threshold (0.1, 0.5, 1.0) does vessel detection degrade?

**Practical Experience**:

- Did you validate that compressed data retains detection accuracy?
- Lossless vs. lossy compression trade-offs?
- Was there a "sweet spot" compression ratio that preserved all useful info?

## Architecture Validation Points

### 1. Edge Infrastructure
