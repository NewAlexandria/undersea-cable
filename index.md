# Marine Cable DAS Data Analysis & Maritime Surveillance Architecture

## Overview

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) on marine cables converts fiber optic cables into arrays of thousands of seismic sensors. This repository includes data analysis tools and complete technical/business architecture for maritime surveillance applications.

## 🎯 Key Discovery: Compression-Based Event Detection

**Compression ratio could serve as a real-time event detector, enabling 62-86% bandwidth reduction while maintaining useful data capture.**

- **Files with compression < 7 contain 2.6x more signal variability** (p < 0.000001, n=906)
- **13% of files contain most interesting events**
- **Potential savings**: \$8M+/year per site in satellite bandwidth costs

## 🔬 Key Findings

### CPU vs GPU at Edge

Modeling shows lossy compression (6-10x) preserves >97% of potential vessel detection information. CPU-based compression at edge with GPU processing in regional datacenters provides:

- **Cost savings**: \$150-250k per site
- **Flexibility**: Can reprocess with new algorithms
- **Acceptable latency**: 1-3 seconds vs. <1 second

### Compression-Based Event Detection

Analysis of 906 files shows that compression ratio is a proxy for event detection:

- **Files with compression < 7 contain 2.6x more signal variability** (p < 0.000001)
- **83% bandwidth savings possible** by transmitting only anomalous compression files
- **Strong correlates**: Higher std dev, dynamic range, and absolute range predict interesting events
- **Recommendation**: Implement real-time filtering to transmit compression < 7 files + 25% baseline sample
