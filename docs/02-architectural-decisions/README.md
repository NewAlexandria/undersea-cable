# Architectural Decisions

This section addresses Section 2 of the [INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md](../INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md): When and how do we scale infrastructure?

## Key Areas

### Architecture Overview

- **[ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_SUMMARY.md](./ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_SUMMARY.md)** - Summary of key architecture choices and trade-offs

### Edge Infrastructure

- **[edge-infrastructure/](./edge-infrastructure/)** - Edge computing decisions
  - CPU vs GPU at edge
  - Hardware standardization
  - Validation questions

### Cloud Strategy

- **[cloud-strategy/](./cloud-strategy/)** - Cloud and multi-cloud decisions
  - Single vs multi-cloud
  - Regional expansion
  - Cost optimization

### Implementation Details

- **[DAS_TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./DAS_TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Detailed technical implementation
- **[processing-pipeline.md](./processing-pipeline.md)** - Data processing pipeline architecture

## Key Decision Points

From [INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md](../INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md#section-2-architectural-scale-milestones):

**Architecture Decision Timeline**:

- When to commit to Option B (CPU + Regional DC) vs Option C (CPU + Cloud)?
- Decision criteria for building first regional datacenter
- Build vs colocate vs lease datacenter infrastructure

**Triggers**:

- After X customer pilots?
- After Y cables deployed?
- After validating Z technical metrics?
