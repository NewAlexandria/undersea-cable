## Key Design Principles

1. **Decision-Driven**: Organized around key decisions that need to be made
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Overview → Details → Implementation
3. **Cross-Referenced**: Clear relationships between sections
4. **Dual-Use**: Optimized for both human cognition and LLM context understanding
5. **Planning-Centric**: Focus on actionable decisions and milestones

## Next Steps

1. Review [INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md](./INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md)
2. Fill in placeholder values ([DATE], $X, etc.) with actual targets
3. Complete action items in priority order
4. Use decision templates for documenting choices
