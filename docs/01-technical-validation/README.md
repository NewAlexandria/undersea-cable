# Technical Validation

This section addresses Section 1 of the [INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md](../INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md): What do we need to prove technically?

## Key Areas

### Compression Fidelity

- **[compression-fidelity/](./compression-fidelity/)** - Validating that compression preserves vessel detection accuracy
  - Information theory analysis
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - Event detection via compression ratio

### Latency Requirements

- **[latency-requirements/](./latency-requirements/)** - Validating acceptable latency for different customer segments
  - Real-time processing architecture
  - Edge vs cloud trade-offs

### Multi-Cable Correlation

- **[multi-cable-correlation/](./multi-cable-correlation/)** - Validating vessel tracking across multiple cables
  - Time synchronization requirements
  - Position estimation accuracy

### Technical Questions

- **[technical-questions.md](./technical-questions.md)** - Key technical validation questions extracted from engineering discussions

## Success Criteria

From [INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md](../INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md#section-1-technical-validation-milestones):

**Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Proof of Concept**

- [ ] Compression validation: X% vessel information preserved at Îµ=0.1
- [ ] Detection accuracy: Y% on Z vessel types
- [ ] Latency: <W seconds end-to-end
- [ ] System uptime: >X% over Y day period
