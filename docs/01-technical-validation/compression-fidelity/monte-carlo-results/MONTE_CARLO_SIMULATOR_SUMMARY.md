# Monte Carlo Business Simulator - Complete Summary

## What I Built For You

I've created a **Monte Carlo simulation system** that turns your strategic questions from `INTERNAL_DECISION_QUESTIONS.md` into an interactive decision-support tool. Instead of single-point estimates, you get **probability distributions** showing the range of possible outcomes.

## The Three-Phase Mental Strategy (Implemented)

The simulator directly supports your three-phase planning approach:

### Phase 1: Strategy & Constraints
- **Simulate**: Define success criteria through go/no-go thresholds
- **Output**: Probability of achieving profitability, Series B qualification
- **Decision support**: Test different risk tolerances

### Phase 2: Architecture & Resources  
- **Simulate**: Compare Option A/B/C with different team sizes and growth rates
- **Output**: Cost trajectories, team requirements, infrastructure needs
- **Decision support**: Optimize architecture choice and resource allocation

### Phase 3: Execution & Partnerships
- **Simulate**: Model customer acquisition rates and partnership timing
- **Output**: Revenue projections, customer counts, cash runway
- **Decision support**: Identify critical path items and timing

## How the Simulation Works

### Month-by-Month Simulation Loop

```
For each of 1000 simulations:
  For each month (0-24):
    1. Deploy cables based on targets (with random delays)
    2. Build regional datacenter if triggered (Option B, 8+ cables)
    3. Acquire customers (stochastic conversion from leads)
    4. Apply monthly churn
    5. Calculate revenue (pricing × customers × competitive erosion)
    6. Calculate costs:
       - Infrastructure (edge + datacenter/cloud)
       - Team (salaries by role)
       - Sales/Marketing
       - Support
    7. Update cash (revenue - costs - capex)
    8. Calculate technical metrics (accuracy, detections, uptime)
    9. Grow team if at 6-month interval
    10. Check for profitability and Series B qualification
    11. Check for failure (cash < 0)
    
  Record: Final metrics, profitability status, failure month
  
Analyze all simulations:
  - Success rates (% profitable, % Series B qualified, % failed)
  - P10/P50/P90 percentiles for all outputs
  - Average time to profitability
```

### Key Simulation Logic

**Customer Acquisition Model**:
```
Leads = cables × leads_per_cable × sales_effectiveness(month)
New customers = Binomial(leads, conversion_rate)
Sales effectiveness ramps: 0% → 100% over first 12 months
```

**Cost Model**:
```
Option A (GPU Edge): $500k/cable capex, $130k/cable/year opex
Option B (Regional DC): $350k/cable capex + $2M datacenter, $30k/cable + $200k DC
Option C (Cloud): $250k/cable capex, $180k/cable/year cloud opex
```

**Regional Datacenter Trigger**:
```
If Option B AND cables_deployed >= 8:
  Build datacenter (one-time $2M capex)
  Reduces per-cable opex by centralizing GPU processing
```

## Key Questions the Simulator Answers

### 1. Which Architecture Option Should We Choose?

**How to test**:
1. Run simulation with Option A (GPU Edge)
2. Run simulation with Option B (Regional DC)
3. Run simulation with Option C (Cloud Only)
4. Compare success rates and final ARR

**Metrics to compare**:
- Profitability rate: Which has highest success rate?
- Failure rate: Which is least risky?
- Median ARR: Which achieves highest revenue?
- Cash remaining: Which provides most runway?

**Example finding**:
```
Option A: 45% success rate, $75M median ARR, 35% failure rate
Option B: 65% success rate, $65M median ARR, 20% failure rate ✓ BEST
Option C: 55% success rate, $60M median ARR, 25% failure rate
```

### 2. How Aggressively Should We Grow?

**How to test**:
1. Conservative: 10 cables @ M12, 20 @ M18
2. Base case: 15 cables @ M12, 30 @ M18
3. Aggressive: 25 cables @ M12, 50 @ M18

**Metrics to compare**:
- Failure rate: Does aggressive growth run out of cash?
- Series B qualification: Do we hit $30M ARR milestone?
- Cash remaining: Do we have buffer for unexpected costs?

**Example finding**:
```
Conservative: 80% success, $45M ARR, but only 30% qualify for Series B
Base case: 65% success, $65M ARR, 55% qualify for Series B ✓ BEST
Aggressive: 35% success, $85M ARR, 65% failure (ran out of cash)
```

### 3. What Team Size Do We Need?

**How to test**:
1. Lean: Start with 3, grow 1.3x every 6 months
2. Base: Start with 5, grow 1.5x every 6 months
3. Aggressive: Start with 8, grow 1.8x every 6 months

**Metrics to compare**:
- Team cost as % of total costs
- Success rate (does small team limit growth?)
- Final team size (realistic for hiring market?)

**Example finding**:
```
Lean: 70% success, but slower customer acquisition
Base: 65% success, balanced ✓ BEST
Aggressive: 55% success, personnel costs too high
```

### 4. Is $10M Series A Sufficient?

**How to test**:
1. Run with $8M Series A
2. Run with $10M Series A
3. Run with $15M Series A

**Metrics to compare**:
- Failure rate at each funding level
- Months of runway (P10 case)
- Time to profitability

**Example finding**:
```
$8M: 40% failure rate (insufficient runway)
$10M: 20% failure rate ✓ ACCEPTABLE
$15M: 10% failure rate (but higher dilution)

Conclusion: $10M is sufficient with base case growth strategy
```

### 5. When Should We Build Regional Datacenter?

**How to test**:
Option B automatically triggers at 8 cables. But you can test:
1. Option C (no datacenter) vs Option B
2. Vary the trigger (6, 8, 10, 12 cables)

**Metrics to compare**:
- Infrastructure costs over time
- Gross margin achieved
- When does Option B become more profitable than Option C?

**Example finding**:
```
Option C (cloud): Lower upfront, but $180k/cable/year
Option B (datacenter @ 8 cables): $2M upfront, but $30k/cable/year after

Crossover point: 12-15 months at 10+ cables
Conclusion: Build datacenter when you have 8-10 cables and visibility to 15+
```

```

## Interpreting Results

### Understanding Percentiles

- **P10 (10th percentile)**: **Pessimistic** - Only 10% of simulations do worse
  - Use for: Risk planning, minimum viable outcomes
  
- **P50 (Median)**: **Expected** - Half do better, half do worse
  - Use for: Base case planning, most likely outcome
  
- **P90 (90th percentile)**: **Optimistic** - Only 10% of simulations do better
  - Use for: Upside scenarios, best case planning

### Example Interpretation

```
Final ARR:
  P10: $35M
  P50: $65M
  P90: $95M
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Best case (10% chance)**: We achieve $95M+ ARR
- **Expected case (50% chance)**: We achieve $65M ARR
- **Worst case (10% risk)**: We only achieve $35M ARR
- **For Series B** ($30M target): 90% confidence we'll qualify

### Red Flags to Watch For

1. **High failure rate (>30%)**: Strategy is too risky
   - **Solution**: Reduce growth targets, increase funding, or reduce costs

2. **P10 cash < $0**: 10% chance of running out of money
   - **Solution**: Increase Series A, reduce burn, or accelerate revenue

3. **Low Series B qualification (<50%)**: May not hit growth milestones
   - **Solution**: More aggressive customer acquisition or higher pricing

4. **Wide P10-P90 range**: High uncertainty
   - **Solution**: Reduce uncertainty in key parameters or plan for flexibility

## Advanced: Customizing the Model

### Adding New Customer Segments

In `das_monte_carlo.py`:

```python
class CustomerSegment(Enum):
    # Add your new segment
    OIL_AND_GAS = "oil_gas"

# In simulation
leads_per_cable[CustomerSegment.OIL_AND_GAS] = 2
conversion_rates[CustomerSegment.OIL_AND_GAS] = 0.20
pricing[CustomerSegment.OIL_AND_GAS.value] = 30_000
```

### Modeling Series B Funding Event

Add funding injection at month 18:

```python
# In run_single_simulation() method
if month == 18 and outputs.series_b_qualified:
    cash += 30_000_000  # Series B injection
```

### Adding Competition Effects

Model market share loss:

```python
# Add to StochasticParameters
market_share_loss_rate: float = 0.05  # 5% annual loss to competition

# In calculate_revenue()
market_share_retention = (1 - self.params.market_share_loss_rate) ** (month / 12)
revenue *= market_share_retention
```

### Adding Marketing Spend → Conversion Relationship

```python
# Add marketing budget as input
marketing_budget_monthly: float = 100_000

# Model conversion as function of marketing
base_conversion = 0.15
marketing_boost = (marketing_budget / 100_000) * 0.10  # 10% boost per $100k
conversion_rate = base_conversion + marketing_boost
```
